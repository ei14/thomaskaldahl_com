			<h1>EAIS: A 9-key keyboard</h1>
			Following my obsession with keyboard layouts, I made a layout which
			uses 9 keys.

			<h2>Contents</h2>
			<ul>

				<li><a href="#design">Design Intent</a></li>
				<li><a href="#code">Source Code</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="specs">Specification</h2>
			The layout can be used on a standard keyboard using the following
			map:
			<img src="eais.gif" />
			<p>
				Each of the 8 letter keys types its respective letter upon
				being pressed, and again upon being released. For example, to
				type "INN", the I key is pressed and held whilst the N key is
				pressed and released.
			</p>
			<p>
				The space-bar inserts a space, but also flags all currently
				held letter keys to be ignored on their next release. After
				typing "INN" and hitting space, the user is free to release the
				I key without an extra I being typed. This transforms each word
				into a sort of gesture, involving having multiple keys pressed
				simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>
				To type the remaining 18 letters of the alphabet, a series of
				substitutions are employed. In the following table, the Input
				is substituted with the Result.
			</p>
			<table style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;font-size:4vh">
				<tr>
					<td>II</td> <td>-&gt;</td> <td>H</td>
					<td><div style="width: 5vw"></div></td>
					<td>AO</td> <td>-&gt;</td> <td>L</td>
					<td><div style="width: 5vw"></div></td>
					<td>AE</td> <td>-&gt;</td> <td>D</td>
				</tr>

					<td>AA</td> <td>-&gt;</td> <td>C</td>
					<td><div style="width: 5vw"></div></td>

			<p>
				The earlier example with the word "INN" is deceptive. Trying to
				type "INN" would output "IW". The burden of later deciphering
				these ambiguities is placed on the writer. A more advanced
				system could implement a spellchecker to relieve this burden.
			</p>

			<h2 id="design">Design Intent</h2>
			<p>
				I wanted to make a digital input system similar to steno-typing,
				used in court rooms. The idea was to enable the user to take
				real-time notes at a speed that would let the writer record live
				speech word for word. I've been wanting to learn such a system
				myself, but my laptop keyboard doesn't support the level of
				rollover needed to use steno-typing software such as Plover.
			</p>
			<p>
				I tried to make a speedy input method compatible with keyboards
				capable of detecting all 8 keys under the home-row plus the
				space bar. The intent was to enable the user to type without
				laterally moving their fingers across the keyboard, but instead
				only pressing and releasing the same 9 keys.
			</p>
			<p>
				I factored in the English alphabet, and the relative
				frequencies of letters in common writing. The "RNOT EAIS"
				selection of letters consists of the 8 most frequent English
				letters placed alternating on each side from the center
				outward, with the intent being factoring the greater strength
				of the index and middle fingers
				compared to the pinkies.
			</p>
			<p>
				The choice of substitutions was based on a ranking of the
				frequencies of two-letter pairs in written English. Out of the
				pairs available with "RNOT EAIS", I chose the 18 least common,
				to minimize the impact of making these letter pairs
				inaccessible by replacing them with other letters.
			</p>
			<p>
				I placed the least frequent letters like Q and Z with the most
				frequent letter pairs like IE and IR. This is because these
				letter pairs are more likely to be replaced when the user
				actually intended to type the pair itself, and uncommon letters
				like Q and Z are easier to spot and decipher. If the user types
				"INN" but it becomes "IW", it's easier to know what was meant
				to be typed, as opposed to it spelling a different valid word
				like "IF".
			</p>

			<h2 id="code">Source Code</h2>
			<p>
				I wrote a C program for Linux/X11. It can be compiled with the
				command "gcc eais.c -o eais -lX11".
			</p>
			<p>
				A blank window is opened; it must be focused in order to
				receive input. The true output is on the command line from
				which the program is invoked.
			</p>
			<p>
				This implementation includes backspace, immediate substitution
				upon the space-bar being pressed, and a timer displaying the
				number of seconds elapsed between each time the Enter key is
				pressed.
