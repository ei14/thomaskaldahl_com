			<h1>Integration Bee Trophy (2023)</h1>
			<p>
				I was a co-president for the Rice University chapter for the
				Association for Women in Mathematics during the 2023-2024
				academic year.
				We teamed up with the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student
				Association to an integration bee, and I designed the trophy.

				I made the trophy in Blender 3D.
				It was 3D printed by Eric Cai, a Rice physics student and
				integral member (pun not intended!) of our organization and
				event running team.
				He and I spray-painted the trophies to get the final look.
