			<p>
				Here is my artistic rendition of what a Redstone block may look
				like if taken from Minecraft into real life. Click
				the image for a closer look.

				I made this image in Blender 3D. The model was created by
				sculpting a cube into an organic shape, aided by a drawing
				tablet and stylus. The material has a layered noise normal map
				for extra surface detail, and has procedurally generated
				luminance brightest at the center of the object. The shards
				around the cube were made by similar means but without
				luminance.
