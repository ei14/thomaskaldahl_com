			<h1>Integration Bee Trophies (2025)</h1>
			<p>
				After I graduated from Rice in December 2024, I was asked if I
				could update the trophies I made for the next Integration Bee
				contest in Spring 2025.
				I was happy to help; initially I planned on simply updating the
				year and sending over all the files necessary to update it in
				future years.
				Eric Cai, responsible for the 3D printing of the trophies last
				year and now, challenged me instead to make some new designs.
				He proposed some ideas of his own: one displaying a normal
				distribution, and one displaying the &quot;Mexican hat&quot;
				plot of the Higgs potential.
				I'm glad he pushed me; I'm happy with what I managed to throw
				together in those couple days.

				The above image features, from left to right:
				Magnitude of the gamma function (complex analysis);
				Some normal distributions (statistics);
				Plot of the Higgs potential (physics);
				Hyperbolic paraboloid (geometry).

				The plates are interchangeable.
				Since there are 4 different designs with no clear ranking
				between them, we gave the 4 winners the chance to choose their
				trophy ornament.
