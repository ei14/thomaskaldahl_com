			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I was born in Maryland and grew up in Iowa. I've been living in
				Texas for the past 8 years. I'm currently attending Rice
				University to earn a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. Once I
				finish, I plan on attending graduate school to further my
				studies. I'm not entirely sure what I'll do after that, but I am
				considering becoming a professor.
			</p>
			<p>
				My mother is Ms. Worldwide. Born in Japan, she attended
				Cambridge in the UK. She's lived in Japan, England, Australia,
				and now, America. She is currently a professor of Asian studies.
			</p>
			<p>
				My father is the jack of all trades. He grew up in the Midwest
				and worked in construction to be able to attend a university. He
				went on to work as an artist, printing press specialist, and
				eventually a professor of video game design and digital art. He
				is currently a self-employed investor.
			</p>
			<p>
				My sister is a warrior. Three years before me, she was born with
				quadriplegic cerebral palsy and rendered unable to walk, talk,
				eat without a stomach tube, or do just about anything without
				assistance. Her childhood was rough, but with diligent help from
				my parents and I, she has grown to find joy in life despite her
				disability. Though she cannot speak a single word, the smile on
				her face speaks millions.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was about 8 years old, my father introduced me to pure
				math and computer science. In lieu of fictional bedtime stories,
				every night my father read for me from a book on the history of
				mathematical discoveries. He sat down with me and taught me how
				to write my first computer program. From that point on, I was
				hooked on math and computer science.
			</p>
			<p>
				I attended Clements High School in Sugar Land, wherein I took
				all the computer science and math courses I could. My physics
				teachers introduced me to the exciting curiosities of mechanics
				and electrodynamics. I joined a Science Olympiad team and a VeX
				robotics team; I discovered that I have a passion for learning
				about science and producing creative applications of it,
				especially when I'm part of a team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rice University is hard. I switched from physics to computer
				science before eventually settling on mathematics. I've
				struggled psychologically, but my grades are nearly straight
				A's, and my professors and friends are very supportive.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I tend to work on various projects. I create
				software that's cool and, sometimes, useful. I like to work with
				electronics and have explored microcontroller programming and
				printed circuit board design. I use Arch Linux and frequently
				explore the capabilities of free and open source software from
				GNU and alike.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like a lot of people, I'm not sure what the future holds for
				me. Regardless of what I do, I'll do it to the best of my
				ability, in order to perform my duty to impart a net good onto
				the human race.
