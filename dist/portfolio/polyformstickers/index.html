Built in is the ability to send "stickers," which are
basically still or animated images that come conveniently from
a prearranged pack.
Normally, these convey emotions, like a more expressive form of emoji.
But since Signal lets users create their own sticker packs, I
could not resist the urge to do something mathy, regardless of
whether or not the images can be used naturally in
conversation.<h2>Contents</h2><ul><li><a href=#design>Design</a><li><a href=#code>Code to generate</a><li><a href=#downloads>Download links</a></ul><h2 id=design>Design</h2><img src=polyominoes_fixed.png><p class=caption>Some fixed polyominoes.<p>A <i>polyomino</i> is an arrangement of equally-sized squares placed edge-to-edge.
The name is a punny reinterpretation of the word "domino," a shape with two squares ("d(u)" "ominoes").
My first sticker pack featured all the <i>fixed</i> polyominoes having between 1 and 5 squares.
Here, fixed means that any flips and rotations of 90 degrees are considered to be distinct and counted separately.
Signal sets a cap of 200 stickers per pack, so I could fit up to order 5 polyominoes in my pack.<p>In case you use Signal and would like to install this sticker pack for your use,
I included download links at the <a href=#downloads>bottom of the page.</a><p>I generated the polyominoes with a Python script.
If you don't mind the messiness, you can find the code in <a href=#code>the next section.</a>
It requires the Pillow image library, and it produces multiple PNG files.</p><img src=182_7_C623000.png><p class=caption>A rotating polyomino.<p>Some would say two polyominoes are the same if one can be rotated to resemble the other.
If we still disallow flips, then we get the so-called <i>one-sided polyominoes,</i> of which there are substantially fewer than fixed polyominoes.
I didn't want to arbitrarily choose one rotation for each, so I animated them to rotate through all their rotations.<p>Some would go further and say two polyominoes are the same if one can be rotated and/or flipped to resemble the other.
This gives us the <i>free polyominoes,</i> and there are even fewer of these.
I decided not to make a sticker pack for these, since it would involve arbitrarily choosing an orientation, or complicating the animation to be orientation-indifferent.</p><img src=polyhexes_fixed.png><p class=caption>Some fixed polyhexes.<p>We can play the same game with hexagons.
These shapes are called <i>polyhexes,</i> and I produced sticker packs for these as well.
Since a hexagon has more sides, there are more ways to connect a given number of them.
Therefore I had to stop at lower orders to fit the stickers into the allotted 200.<p>I'm guilty of some over-engineering here.
To handle the placements of hexagons on a hexagon grid,
I created a small Python library that handles the Eisenstein Integers,
a set of complex numbers that form a hexagonal lattice arrangement.
I implemented arithmetic for these, conversion to complex numbers, and a method that rounds any complex number to a closest Eisenstein Integer.
I also implemented Gaussian Integers, which live in a square grid arrangement.
The library is included in the <a href=#code>code section</a> below.</p><img src=6_144_1e4400.png><p class=caption>A rotating polyhex.<p>I repeated the same process as with polyominoes to create a sticker pack for one-sided polyhexes.</p><img src=polyiamonds_fixed.png><p class=caption>Some fixed polyiamonds.<p>There is only one more shape that regularly tiles the Euclidean plane: the triangle.
The polyomino equivalent for triangles is the <i>polyiamond,</i> a pun on "diamond," the word for a shape with two triangles ("d(uo)" "iamonds").<p>To produce these, I made good use of my complex integer library.
In the hexagonal case, every Eisenstein Integer nicely corresponds to a tiled hexagon.
In the image below, each dot is an Eisenstein Integer.
The blue ones correspond to triangles.
The red ones do not, and they happen to land on the triangle vertices.</p><img src=eisenstein_triangle.avif><p>Treating these points as Eisenstein Integers, we can conveniently describe the red points as
Eisenstein Integers that are <i>congruent</i> to 0 <i>modulo</i> -1 + &#969;.
I did implement modular arithmetic into my complex integer library, making it easy to
describe triangles in code.
It even had the bonus effect of letting me determine the orientation of a triangle based on its congruency modulo -1 + &#969;.</p><img src=8_00030406020c00000000.png><p>And of course, you know I had to animate rotating one-sided polyiamonds.<h2 id=code>Code</h2>Beware, the code is a bit messy.<ul><li><a href=polyominoes_fixed.py>Fixed polyominoes.</a> Requires Pillow image library.
