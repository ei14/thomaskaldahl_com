could update the trophies I made for the next Integration Bee
contest in Spring 2025.
I was happy to help; initially I planned on simply updating the
year and sending over all the files necessary to update it in
future years.
Eric Cai, responsible for the 3D printing of the trophies last
year and now, challenged me instead to make some new designs.
He proposed some ideas of his own: one displaying a normal
distribution, and one displaying the "Mexican hat"
plot of the Higgs potential.
I'm glad he pushed me; I'm happy with what I managed to throw
together in those couple days.</p><a href=render_hd.avif><img src=render.avif></a><p class=caption>Click for HD.<p>The above image features, from left to right:
Magnitude of the gamma function (complex analysis);
Some normal distributions (statistics);
Plot of the Higgs potential (physics);
Hyperbolic paraboloid (geometry).</p><img src=sprayed.avif><p class=caption>Eric handled the spray painting.<p>The plates are interchangeable.
Since there are 4 different designs with no clear ranking
between them, we gave the 4 winners the chance to choose their
trophy ornament.</p><a href=winners_hd.avif><img src=winners.avif></a><p class=caption>Three of the four winners. Click for HD.</div>
