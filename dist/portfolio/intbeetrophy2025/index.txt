Integration Bee Trophies (2025)

After I graduated from Rice in December 2024, I was asked if I could
update the trophies I made for the next Integration Bee contest in
Spring 2025. I was happy to help; initially I planned on simply updating
the year and sending over all the files necessary to update it in future
years. Eric Cai, responsible for the 3D printing of the trophies last
year and now, challenged me instead to make some new designs. He
proposed some ideas of his own: one displaying a normal distribution,
and one displaying the "Mexican hat" plot of the Higgs potential. I'm
glad he pushed me; I'm happy with what I managed to throw together in
those couple days.

function (complex analysis); Some normal distributions (statistics);
Plot of the Higgs potential (physics); Hyperbolic paraboloid (geometry).

Eric handled the spray painting.

The plates are interchangeable. Since there are 4 different designs with
no clear ranking between them, we gave the 4 winners the chance to
choose their trophy ornament.
