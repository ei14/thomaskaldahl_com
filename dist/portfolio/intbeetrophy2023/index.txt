Integration Bee Trophy (2023)

I was a co-president for the Rice University chapter for the Association
for Women in Mathematics during the 2023-2024 academic year. We teamed
up with the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Association to an
integration bee, and I designed the trophy.

I made the trophy in Blender 3D. It was 3D printed by Eric Cai, a Rice
physics student and integral member (pun not intended!) of our
organization and event running team. He and I spray-painted the trophies
to get the final look.
