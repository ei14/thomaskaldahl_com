Association for Women in Mathematics during the 2023-2024
academic year.
We teamed up with the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student
Association to an integration bee, and I designed the trophy.</p><a href=trophy_3d_hd.avif><img src=trophy_3d.avif></a><p class=caption>Click for HD.<p>I made the trophy in Blender 3D.
It was 3D printed by Eric Cai, a Rice physics student and
integral member (pun not intended!) of our organization and
event running team.
He and I spray-painted the trophies to get the final look.</p><a href=int_bee_ad.webp><img src=int_bee_ad.webp></a><p class=caption>Pictured: An advertisement for the contest I wrote and
