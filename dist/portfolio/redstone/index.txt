Realistic Redstone Block

Here is my artistic rendition of what a Redstone block may look like if
taken from Minecraft into real life. Click the image for a closer look.

I made this image in Blender 3D. The model was created by sculpting a
cube into an organic shape, aided by a drawing tablet and stylus. The
material has a layered noise normal map for extra surface detail, and
has procedurally generated luminance brightest at the center of the
object. The shards around the cube were made by similar means but
without luminance.
