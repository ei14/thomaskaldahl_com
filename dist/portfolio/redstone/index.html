like if taken from Minecraft into real life. Click
the image for a closer look.</p><a href=redstone.png><img src=redstone.png></a><p>I made this image in Blender 3D. The model was created by
sculpting a cube into an organic shape, aided by a drawing
tablet and stylus. The material has a layered noise normal map
for extra surface detail, and has procedurally generated
luminance brightest at the center of the object. The shards
around the cube were made by similar means but without
luminance.</div>
