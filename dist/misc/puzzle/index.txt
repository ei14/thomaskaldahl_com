This is u/ei283 responding to a post by u/PARREnoia on r/puzzles.
Through some diagrams and animations, I'm going to try to illustrate how
to solve the particular wooden block puzzle at hand.
Here are all the pieces to the puzzle:
[]
There are three axis pieces, 5 identical leaf pieces, and 1 leaf piece
with a small cutout.
I created an animation below to roughly show the assembly process.

First, the three axis pieces are assembled to create the base.
You sort of have to hold it in place with your fingers, as the structure
can sort of slide during assembly.
When assembling the axes, it is important that from any view, only 2
cutout sections can be seen, not 4 nor 0. Like so: []
Then as shown in the video, I first add the leaf piece with the cutout.
This piece is important because it can turn, creating room to add the
last two pieces later.
Three leaf pieces can trivially be added.
The last two pieces can then be inserted by rotating the leaf piece with
the cutout on it.
Message me or reply to my comment if you have any questions!
