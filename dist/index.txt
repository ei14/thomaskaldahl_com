Hi! I'm Thomas Kaldahl.
I am a sophomore at Rice University.
I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.
Currently (August 2022), I am researching the migration of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) using phylogenetic analysis at a biological
anthropology lab under a professor of the University of Iowa.

This website is intended as a showcase for my personal works and
explorations.
Feel free to browse around using the menu on top.
